# TODO: Check what branch the fusionauth-appsembler-theme is being checked out from. 
# Might need to specify to checkout staging if it's checking out main by default

# Needed to create a PAT in my GitHub profile settings with read/write access rights to be able to checkout the
# fusionauth-theme-files repo above. Then save the PAT as an env variable in this gh-actions-test repo.
